# NotBuiltYet

AI ideas too good to not exist.

A community-vetted, open-source collection of business ideas enhanced by AI — real problems across healthcare, agriculture, education, infrastructure, and more — that nobody has built yet. Browse them, vote on them, or just pick one and build it.

**Website**: [shivankar-madaan.github.io/notbuiltyet](https://shivankar-madaan.github.io/notbuiltyet)

## Why This Exists

AI is moving fast, but the biggest opportunities aren't where everyone is looking. There are hundreds of real, viable ideas where AI could make things dramatically better — and nobody is working on them. This repo is a catalog of those ideas, researched with AI and vetted by humans, free for anyone to build.

## How It Works

### 1. Submit an Idea

Anyone can submit an idea by [opening an issue](https://github.com/shivankar-madaan/notbuiltyet/issues/new?template=idea.yml). The template asks you to fill in:

- **Category** — Healthcare, Agriculture, Education, Infrastructure, Finance, Environment, Logistics, or Other
- **Idea Title** — A clear, concise name
- **Problem & Solution** — What's broken today and how AI fixes it
- **Estimated Improvement** — How much better this could be (e.g. "~60% improvement over current")
- **Competitive Moats** — What makes this defensible (data moat, network effects, regulatory, technical, domain expertise, first mover, integration depth)
- **Viability Estimate** — How realistic is this (90-100%, 75-89%, 50-74%, 25-49%)
- **Overall Defensibility** — Very High, High, Medium, or Low

You don't need to have all the answers — submit what you have and the community will help refine it.

### 2. Vote and Discuss

Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/shivankar-madaan/notbuiltyet/issues) and give a 👍 reaction to ideas you think are worth building. Leave comments with feedback, market research, technical insights, or domain expertise. The best ideas rise to the top through community discussion.

### 3. Vetting

Maintainers review discussed ideas and add the `vetted` label to those that are well-researched and viable. Once an idea is vetted, it automatically appears on the website with its viability score, moat analysis, and vote count.

### 4. Build It

See something you want to build? Go for it. No permission needed. If you're actively working on an idea, let us know and we'll add the `being-built` label. When you ship it, we'll mark it as `launched`.

## Idea Lifecycle

| Stage | Label | What It Means |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Submitted | `idea` | A new idea has been proposed (auto-applied) |
| Vetted | `vetted` | Reviewed and approved — listed on the website |
| Being Built | `being-built` | Someone is actively building this |
| Launched | `launched` | Shipped as a real product |

## What Makes a Good Idea

- **Real problem** — Something that affects real people, not a solution looking for a problem
- **AI-enhanced** — AI should be a core part of why this works, not bolted on
- **Viable** — Technically feasible with today's technology
- **Defensible** — Has at least one competitive moat
- **Underserved** — Nobody is doing this well yet (or at all)
