        "problem": "Construction is one of the least digitized industries in the world, and it shows. Projects routinely run over budget and behind schedule — globally, large construction projects average 80% over budget and 20 months behind schedule. The consequences ripple through society: Wasted resources: Delays and rework waste materials, energy, and human labor on a massive scale Safety failures: Construction remains one of the most dangerous industries. Poor site monitoring means safety violations (missing PPE, improper scaffolding, unsecured zones) go undetected until someone gets hurt Accountability gaps: Progress is tracked through subjective site visits and inconsistent photo documentation — there's no reliable, quantifiable way to know if a project is on track Infrastructure bottlenecks: Hospitals, schools, housing, and public infrastructure projects get delayed for years, directly impacting the communities waiting for them Fraud and misreporting: Without verifiable progress data, misrepresentation of construction status is difficult to detect — affecting public projects and aid-funded developments in particular",
        "solution": "A platform that uses drone and satellite imagery combined with computer vision to automatically monitor construction sites — turning raw visual data into objective, quantifiable progress metrics. How It Works: Data Collection — Drones capture high-resolution aerial footage on a regular schedule. Freely available satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, Landsat) supplements with continuous coverage AI Analysis — Computer vision models detect and quantify structural progress (foundation, floors, walls), material stockpiles, equipment activity, and critically — safety violations like missing barriers or workers without protective equipment Transparency & Alerts — Automated reports with visual before/after comparisons, real-time dashboards showing objective completion metrics, and immediate alerts when progress deviates from plan or safety issues are detected",
        "why": "Makes construction safer by catching safety violations in near real-time instead of after an accident Makes public infrastructure projects accountable with verifiable, objective progress data Reduces waste by catching deviations early when course-correction is still cheap Enables transparency for aid-funded and government projects where misreporting is a real problem Helps close the infrastructure gap in developing regions by making project oversight scalable and affordable"
