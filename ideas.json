        "problem": "The asteroid mining industry is emerging fast — multiple startups are racing to extract resources from near-Earth asteroids. But they all face the same bottleneck: we know where asteroids are (NASA tracks 30,000+ NEOs), but we barely know what they're made of. Spectral data exists for only a fraction of known asteroids, and even when it does, going from \"S-type classification\" to \"estimated platinum content\" is unreliable. The best public tool for this was built in 2012 with naive heuristics and appears unmaintained. Composition prediction from sparse spectral data remains a hard, unsolved problem — current ML models only achieve ~92% accuracy on broad taxonomic groups and routinely confuse critical categories (C-type vs X-type). Mining companies are making multi-million dollar mission decisions with terrible geological intelligence.",
        "solution": "An AI-native asteroid prospecting platform that fuses public data from NASA (NeoWs, JPL SBDB), ESA, JAXA, GAIA spacecraft, and ground-based surveys to build the most comprehensive composition intelligence layer for asteroids. Modern ML models trained on meteorite spectra, orbital family membership, albedo, and multi-parameter constraints to predict composition where spectral data is sparse or missing. Each asteroid gets an economic viability score combining estimated resource value, delta-v accessibility, launch window frequency, rotation rate, and size. Real-time updates as new survey data arrives. Essentially the Bloomberg Terminal for asteroid mining — the intelligence layer that every mining company needs but none are building as a standalone product.",
        "why": "Asteroid resources represent a multi-trillion dollar frontier — a single metallic asteroid can contain more platinum-group metals than ever mined on Earth. But this industry can't scale on guesswork. The companies launching missions need reliable geological intelligence the same way terrestrial mining companies rely on geological surveys before drilling. By making this intelligence accessible, this platform accelerates the entire space mining industry, lowers the cost of bad bets, and helps humanity access the resources needed for long-term civilizational growth beyond Earth. The data is already public and free — the AI interpretation layer is what's missing."

        "problem": "Construction is one of the least digitized industries in the world, and it shows. Projects routinely run over budget and behind schedule — globally, large construction projects average 80% over budget and 20 months behind schedule. The consequences ripple through society: Wasted resources: Delays and rework waste materials, energy, and human labor on a massive scale Safety failures: Construction remains one of the most dangerous industries. Poor site monitoring means safety violations (missing PPE, improper scaffolding, unsecured zones) go undetected until someone gets hurt Accountability gaps: Progress is tracked through subjective site visits and inconsistent photo documentation — there's no reliable, quantifiable way to know if a project is on track Infrastructure bottlenecks: Hospitals, schools, housing, and public infrastructure projects get delayed for years, directly impacting the communities waiting for them Fraud and misreporting: Without verifiable progress data, misrepresentation of construction status is difficult to detect — affecting public projects and aid-funded developments in particular",
        "solution": "A platform that uses drone and satellite imagery combined with computer vision to automatically monitor construction sites — turning raw visual data into objective, quantifiable progress metrics. How It Works: Data Collection — Drones capture high-resolution aerial footage on a regular schedule. Freely available satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, Landsat) supplements with continuous coverage AI Analysis — Computer vision models detect and quantify structural progress (foundation, floors, walls), material stockpiles, equipment activity, and critically — safety violations like missing barriers or workers without protective equipment Transparency & Alerts — Automated reports with visual before/after comparisons, real-time dashboards showing objective completion metrics, and immediate alerts when progress deviates from plan or safety issues are detected",
        "why": "Makes construction safer by catching safety violations in near real-time instead of after an accident Makes public infrastructure projects accountable with verifiable, objective progress data Reduces waste by catching deviations early when course-correction is still cheap Enables transparency for aid-funded and government projects where misreporting is a real problem Helps close the infrastructure gap in developing regions by making project oversight scalable and affordable"
